# Boto--S3-MIG
The Script migrate empty file name  data from a Scality S3 cluster to a Ceph S3 cluster using the boto library in Python
1. Importing Libraries
The code starts by importing the necessary libraries: boto for interacting with S3-compatible storage, os for operating system interactions, and shutil for high-level file operations.

2. Setting Access and Secret Keys
The code sets access and secret keys for both the Scality cluster (old) and the Ceph cluster (new). These keys are used to authenticate with the clusters.

3. Connecting to Clusters
The code connects to both clusters using the boto.connect_s3 function, specifying the host and other connection parameters.

4. Looping Through Buckets in the Scality Cluster
The code iterates through all the buckets in the Scality cluster using the old_conn.get_all_buckets() function.

5. Looping Through Objects in Each Bucket
For each bucket, the code loops through all the objects (keys) using the bucket.list() method.

6. Handling Subfolders with No Name
Within each bucket, the code checks for subfolders with no name. If such subfolders exist, the code does the following:

Creates a local directory to download the subfolder.
Downloads the objects within the subfolder locally.
Uploads an empty folder with no name to the new cluster.
Uploads the downloaded files to the new cluster.
7. Printing Status Messages
Throughout the process, the code prints messages to indicate the progress, such as downloading folders, uploading empty folders, and uploading files.

Considerations
The code is meant to handle a specific case where there might be subfolders with no name, and it takes care to migrate them properly.
This is a one-time migration script to move data from one cluster to another.
The lack of error handling means that any failure during the process (e.g., network issues, permission errors) would lead to an unhandled exception.
The code assumes that the structure of the buckets (including names) in the new cluster matches the old one, as it doesn't handle bucket creation in the new cluster.
